# Quizzes
## HNG I7 - team-gold

native Quiz Application built with Flutter using the Dart Programming Language
Utilizing Json files for the questions

## To get started:
Fork the repository at the top right corner
Click on clone or download, copy the url you see after clicking on it
Head to your local machine and create a folder with an appropriate name
Right-click anywhere in the folder and choose git bash here, automatically git bash will open.
In your terminal or gitbash do git clone https://github.com/<your-github-user-name>/Team-Gold-Mobile.git
for me it will look like this -> git clone https://github.com/ugwulo/Team-Gold-Mobile.git
start your work do cd Team-Gold-Mobile
Now you need to add an upstream to track changes in the remote repository

run git remote add upstream https://github.com/hngi/Team-Gold-Mobile.git
run `git pull upstream development

## Now you need to create a new branch corresponding to what you are working on
example, if you are working on a feature called Widget it should be like this ->

git checkout -b feat/widget or git checkout -b feat/widget-quiz-questions (use hiphen to seperate different words).

Make your Contribution, When you are done ->

run git add .

run git commit -m "feature: create <whatever-you-did>"

run git push origin feat/widget remember, it should be the name of the branch you created earlier.

Go-To github, locate the repository you forked earlier, you will see compare and pull request
click on it and type your message, click on create pull request.

Wait for merge and or get on with another feature.

# Happy Contributing!!
